QHOCR is a front end to hocr by Kobi Zamir.

The GUI compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. It shuold work on Embeded-Linux and Mac.

How to help?
See the README in hocr directory. You can also contact Diego Iastrubni <elcuco@kde.org>.

I would like to thank Kovi for his great work on the library, and making the intefaces *so* clean,
that they could be ported that easily. I aslo thank him for the initial GUIs, from which I ... learned 
... and copied... :)

This app uses libhocr 0.8.2 staticly. I will update this soon to dynamically load lihocr.

You can always get the newest version of qhocr from:
