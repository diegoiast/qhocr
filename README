QHOCR is a front end to hocr by Kobi Zamir.

The GUI compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. It shuold work on Embeded-Linux
 and Mac, and probably any other platform supported by Qt4.

How to help?
See the README in hocr directory. You can also contact Diego Iastrubni 
<elcuco@kde.org>.

I would like to thank Kobi for his great work on the library, and making the 
intefaces *so* clean, that they could be ported that easily. I aslo thank him 
for the initial GUIs, from which I ... learned ... and copied... :)

This app uses libhocr 0.8.2 staticly. 
You can always get the newest version of qhocr from:
