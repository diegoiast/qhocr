QHOCR is a front end to hebocr originall by Dr. Kobi Zamir.


The GUI compiles and runs on Windows and Linux. It shuold work on Embeded-Linux
 and Mac, and probably any other platform supported by Qt5.

I would like to thank Kobi for his great work on the library, and making the 
intefaces *so* clean, that they could be ported that easily. I aslo thank him 
for the initial GUIs, from which I ... learned ... and copied... :)


How to build:

Clone this directory, and inside it clone Kobi's library. On linux/mac this can
be done with these lines:


	git clone https://github.com/diegoiast/qhocr.git qhocr
	git clone https://github.com/yaacov/hebocr.git qhocr/hebocr


If you are running Windows, please clone qhocr from this repo:
https://github.com/diegoiast/qhocr.git

and then inside that clone, clone another sub direcory from this repo:
https://github.com/yaacov/hebocr.git qhocr/hebocr
