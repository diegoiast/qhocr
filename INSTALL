If you use the free edition, you will also need MinGW 4:

This release was tested with MinGW 4.1.0 and qt-win-opensource-desktop-4.0.0-mingw 
or qt-win-opensource-4.0.1-mingw

To compile this program, you need to run the batch file "mingw-build.bat".
If you installed Qt or MinGW in a non standard location, you will have to
edit the first lines of the batch file. When the compilation finishes, the EXE file
will be copied to the root of the project. 

To clean the project, you may run from the command line "mingw32-make clean",
or execute the file "mingw-clean.bat".
